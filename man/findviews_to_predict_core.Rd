\title{Views of a multidimensional dataset, ranked by their prediction power, non-Shiny version.}
\usage{
findviews_to_predict_core(target, data, view_size_max = NULL,
  clust_method = "complete")
}
\arguments{
\item{target}{Name of the variable to be predicted.}

\item{data}{Data frame or matrix to be processed}

\item{view_size_max}{Maximum number of columns in the views. If set to
\code{NULL}, findviews uses \code{log2(ncol(data))}, rounded upwards and
capped at 5.}

\item{clust_method}{Character describing a clustering method, used internally
by \code{\link[stats]{hclust}}. Example values are "complete", "single" or
"average".}
}
\description{
\code{findviews_to_predict_core} detects groups of mutually dependent
columns, and ranks them by their predictive power.  It produces the same
results as \code{\link{findviews_to_predict}}, but does \emph{not}
present them with a Shiny app.
}
\details{
The function \code{findviews_to_predict_core} takes a data set and a target
variable as input. It detects clusters of statistically dependent columns in
the data set - e.g., views - and ranks those groups according to how well
they predict the target variable.
See the documentation of \code{\link{findviews_to_predict}} for more
details.

The  difference between \code{\link{findviews_to_predict}} and
\code{\link{findviews_to_predict_core}} is that the former presents its results
with a Shiny app, while the latter simply outputs them as R stuctures.
